# Riptide

Ripide is a powerful scripting language and interpreter that seeks to accomplish two goals:

- Provide a powerful, stream-oriented scripting language where the UNIX philosophy is first-class.
- Provide an interactive and programmable console interface for using your system.

## Status

Riptide is currently in rough development, so expect many things to not work correctly. I work on Riptide in my free time only occasionally, so it may take a while before it becomes ready to be used. I'm committed to finishing it one day though, so maybe check back in a year or so?
